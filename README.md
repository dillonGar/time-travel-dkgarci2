I am learning to use git to create a magazine and performs different tasks with it.
The gitignore ignore the log files, temporary files and windows operating system, to hopefully keep the git clean.
Author/idea-sprint is used to come up with ideas for future magazines.
Editor/review is used to make any edits or revisions to any new content to be added.
